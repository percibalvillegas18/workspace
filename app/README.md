## 📦 What Was Built — Spec Coverage (39 Sections)

### Core Architecture (Section 2)
- **2.8 Frontend code-splitting:** React.lazy per route, manualChunks vendor-react/vendor-antd/vendor-utils, NavLink preload on hover/focus, PageSkeleton fallback, bundle budget gate (entry 66KB gz < 200KB target MET, route chunks <150KB, vendor long-cached)
- **2.9 Hospital organizational structure:** 5 departments (EMAC, SURG, CRIT, GNSP, CORP), 47 nursing units, 582 beds baseline (editable). CRUD for departments/units/bed capacity, bulk capacity API `PUT /units/bed-capacity/bulk`, CSV import `POST /units/import` dry-run default true, per-unit bed_capacity_log with actor/reason, summary endpoint `GET /units/summary` = live total (Baseline 582 → Configured N), soft deletes, FK integrity, coverage integration
- **2.10 i18n RTL:** i18next + react-i18next, en/ar JSON, dir="rtl" toggle, ConfigProvider direction rtl, Ant Design RTL, bilingual notifications, Intl date/number, no hardcoded strings

### Identity & Onboarding (Section 3)
- **3.1 Contract-first onboarding (Bulletproof V36):** `fn_onboard_employee_with_contract` SECURITY DEFINER, position_active check, atomic employee+approved contract+audit via fn_append_audit_entry, SET search_path, no blanket EXCEPTION handler, REVOKE INSERT employees from runtime, direct INSERT → Permission Denied, duplicate job number surfaces real error code, zero rows on failure
- **3.1.1 Position directory:** 16 positions (14 active, 2 deprecated AHN→ACTING_HEAD, CI→NURSE_EDUCATOR), FK on employees.position + credential_requirements.position, tiers (Executive non-schedulable, Management, Specialist, Advanced Practice, Clinical Lead, Clinical, Support, Clinical Specialist), CRUD via API, is_active validation rejects deactivated for new assignments, schedulability toggle demotes future published assignments to draft, soft delete blocked when employees hold code, audit trail
- **3.4 Browser session hardening:** Refresh token HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax cookie `nurseapp_refresh` scoped to `/api/v1/auth` (not __Host- — requires Path=/), Lax not Strict so survives SSO redirect (3.5), access token JS variable 15min, CSRF token in body sent as X-CSRF-Token header, Origin check + custom header defense in depth, guard order AuthGuard→RbacGuard→CsrfGuard at controller level (not APP_GUARD — would run before auth, req.user undefined)
- **3.5 PAM & Four-Eyes (V42):** Privileged sessions table (user_id PK, elevated_at, expires_at, reason, authorized_by, check_expiry), JIT elevation, admin_approval_requests (initiator_id, approver_id, action_type, payload JSONB, status PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED/EXECUTED, partial unique index uq_admin_request_pending ON initiator_id+action_type WHERE status=PENDING), SELECT FOR UPDATE lock, PENDING precondition, self-approval forbidden 403, executeAction(tx,...) same transaction
- **3.6 Break-glass (V44):** Root account split 2 halves in separate safes, bypasses PAM+four-eyes, siren event irrevocable break_glass_events entry, emergency SMS/email to CEO+IT Director, 4h limit auto-revoked

### Credentials (Section 5)
- **5.1 Credential catalog CRUD:** 5 categories (IDENTITY, LICENSURE, LIABILITY, COMPETENCY, LIFE_SUPPORT), 16 templates with field definitions JSONB (text, date, date_hijri, select, number, country, reference, isExpiryDate, isIssueDate), has_expiry, requires_upload, display_order, is_active, CRUD via API with referential safety, requirements CRUD (unit required, position optional null=all, is_mandatory, policy_status MANDATORY/TRANSITION, transition_deadline), bulk set, triggers eligibility revalidation, audit trail
- **5.3 Secure evidence vault (V41):** storage_key private, file_checksum SHA-256 tampering detection, is_orphaned, direct URL 403, signed URL 30s then 403, SHA-256 on upload, tampering alert on integrity scan, cleanup cycle removes orphaned files, private storage no public access
- **5.3.2 Upload quarantine:** PENDING→ClamAV scan→CLEAN/INFECTED, only CLEAN downloadable, infected deleted, EICAR test, content-type spoofing rejected (magic bytes), retry exhausts after 3, current approved remains available during replacement, max 10MB configurable
- **5.4 SCFHS integration + Resilience (V40):** mTLS connectivity, nightly sync, auto-suspend on REVOKED, discrepancy notifications to HR, fallback manual when unreachable, sync_status SYNCED/STALE/FAILED/PENDING, last_sync_attempt, sync_error_count, external_api_health circuit breaker table (api_name PK, is_available, failure_count, last_failure_at, recovery_time), rate-limiter prevents 100+ rapid requests IP blocking, 500 errors trip breaker 15min, outage keeps eligible 48h under STALE

### Eligibility (Section 6)
- **6.1 Canonical engine + Materialized (V39):** One DB function check_nurse_eligibility + one app service, frontend/worker/API same impl, combines employment+compliance+assignment, employee_eligibility_state table (employee_id PK, status ELIGIBLE/ELIGIBLE_WITH_GRACE/INELIGIBLE, reasons JSONB, last_calculated_at, updated_by_event), index status, <50ms roster queries regardless of rule complexity, daily cron refreshes without blocking API, publication re-validates against canonical inside transaction while state serves pool/dashboard
- **6.1.1 Grace periods:** Activates on expiry with renewal in progress, ELIGIBLE_WITH_GRACE, expiry demotes assignments to draft, renewal approval closes grace, no stacking across cycles, audit trail, recommended defaults 30d SCFHS, 14d BLS/ACLS/PALS, 30d passport/ID, 0d hospital ID, 7d core competency, 0d malpractice, configurable per template via GracePeriodService
- **6.1.2 Waivers & Policy Transitions (V48):** Emergency waivers table (employee_id, template_id, waived_by, expiry_date, reason, created_at, chk_waiver_max_window expiry <= created_at+72h DB enforced, chk_waiver_future), 72h max, expiry auto-reverts to INELIGIBLE, high-priority audit, policy_status TRANSITION with transition_deadline, eligible but Policy Warning alert, deadline passed → INELIGIBLE

### Notifications (Section 7)
- **7.1 Daily scan:** 06:00 Asia/Riyadh = 03:00 UTC, contract 90d window, credential 60d + expired, grace expiry, unique event keys prevent duplicates, window-based queries catch up, missed-run recovery
- **7.2-7.4 SMTP:** Real Nodemailer, persisted attempts, retries, lease/retry semantics, hospital relay STARTTLS 587, service account nurseapp@aigh.sa, failure monitoring
- **7.6 Push:** Device token registration/deregistration, FCM + hospital gateway adapters, failed tokens deactivated, delivery log, fallback dashboard+SMTP when push fails, bilingual templates (reads user preferred language)

### Audit & Persistence (Section 9)
- **9.1 Domain audit (hash-chained):** audit_entries DDL + fn_append_audit_entry (hash, previous_hash, advisory serialized), transactional, append-only, runtime REVOKE DELETE/UPDATE, restore checklist verifies chain lag() check, V36 onboarding uses chained audit not raw INSERT, V38 crypto-shredding user_encryption_keys (user_id PK, encrypted_user_key encrypted by master, key_version), audit_entries is_encrypted, encryption_key_id, deleting key makes PII unreadable chain remains valid — Right to Erasure without deleting rows
- **9.2 Request audit:** Interceptor captures all requests, redaction prevents sensitive leakage, X-Request-Id traces end-to-end, denied/failed coverage
- **9.3 Redis non-authoritative + Circuit Breaker (V43):** Redis outage triggers DB fallback, no 500, sensitive ops fresh DB queries, circuit recovers auto on restart, authorization reads PostgreSQL and denies on DB failure
- **9.5 Idempotency (V33 addendum):** Idempotency-Key header required on onboarding/invitation/publication/bulk, 400 if missing, 409 only while lease live, lapsed keys retaken not blocked, processingLeaseExpiresAt column, key row committed with business mutation same transaction, replay payload identifiers only never full bodies (PDPL), cleanup worker daily via lease reaps expired keys+lapsed leases

### Deployment & Operations (Section 10)
- **10.2-10.3 Separate worker + Worker Leases V49:** API main.ts HTTP listener controllers guards no schedulers, worker main-worker.ts cron jobs SMTP no HTTP, WorkerModule ScheduleModule.forRoot() only in worker, 7 jobs migrated: daily_scan 900s, smtp_queue 120s, scfhs_sync 1800s, grace_expiry 600s, idempotency_cleanup 300s, backup_freshness 600s, quarantine_scan 300s, worker_leases table (job_name PK, holder_id UUID, acquired_at, heartbeat_at, expires_at, lease_seconds), worker_lease_status view, WorkerLeaseService withLease (race-free conditional upsert acquire INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE WHERE holder_id=self OR expires_at<now(), heartbeat 1/3 lease, release DELETE WHERE holder_id=self, expired takeover after crash, returns false when another live holds lease — skip cycle), legacy advisory locks 100001-100007 marked SUPERSEDED but reused as lease keys
- **10.6 Backup & PITR (F-23 fixed in 2.8.7b):** Three tiers — continuous WAL archiving archive_timeout=300 → RPO ≤5min bounded ≈1min under write, nightly full pg_basebackup --format=tar --compress=gzip:6 (verified on PG 15.19 --gzip and --compress=6 both valid, clarity not functional defect, old script encrypted non-existent path because --format=tar writes DIRECTORY containing base.tar.gz+pg_wal.tar.gz not single file — now packs before encryption), document rsync nightly, encrypted GPG public-key backup host only private key restore host only dedicated keyring, envelope check vs decryptability split, archive_command encrypts to TMP envelope check non-empty+public-key encrypted via gpg --list-packets then mv atomically never partial, restore_command uses wal-restore.sh wrapper that returns non-zero without creating %p when segment missing (old redirected decrypt >%p leaving zero-length WAL aborting recovery), restore-database.sh finds most recent base before target time decrypts via private key from GPG_HOME configures recovery.signal+postgresql.auto.conf restore_command recovery_target_time recovery_target_action=promote waits pg_is_in_recovery false integrity checks, RPO derivation archive_timeout+shipping delay not sub-minute target below 5min requires lowering archive_timeout to 60s re-measuring, RTO <4h, monthly drill random point past 7 days timed restore checklist 10 steps, backup monitoring stale >26h WAL inactive storage alerts via lease, retention 30d full 7d WAL
- **10.7 Privilege separation:** 4 roles nurseapp_owner (superuser-granted provisioning only), nurseapp_migration (CREATE/ALTER/DROP, migration journal, CI/CD only, MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL), nurseapp_runtime (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE business, USAGE/SELECT sequences, EXECUTE functions, REVOKE CREATE/TRUNCATE, REVOKE DELETE/UPDATE audit_entries, REVOKE INSERT employees onboarding via fn only, contracts writable under trg_contract_status_guard), nurseapp_backup (pg_read_all_data+REPLICATION read-only), nurseapp_audit_reader (SELECT audit/log tables no business), post-migration hook re-applies grants, password rotation per role separate secrets, temporary role nurseapp_migration_admin 48h before go-live bypasses REVOKE INSERT for cutover deleted after commitValidatedData() logged in migration_audit_log, fn_contract_status_guard BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE contracts valid status sane dates
- **10.8 Deep observability V43:** system_health_metrics (metric_name PK, current_value, status HEALTHY/WARNING/CRITICAL, last_updated, threshold_value, alert_message), consistency_audit_log (employee_id, expected_status, actual_status, drift_detected, resolved_at), ConsistencyAuditorWorker daily 03:00 samples 1% workforce runs canonical engine vs state table logs drift triggers refreshState updates drift_rate metric null-safe missing state row=drift not crash (B-13), vital signs SCFHS freshness PAM-audit gap storage integrity SHA-256 weekly backup age, business health API /api/v1/system/health/business returns JSON report for IT dashboard
- **10.9 Operational survivability V44:** break_glass_events (actor_id, access_timestamp, reason, ip_address INET, event_type Siren_Activated, resolved_at non-deletable), eligibility_shadow_log (employee_id, active_status, candidate_status, discrepancy, logic_version, created_at), shadow mode parallel execution active vs candidate discrepancy logged promotion after 7d zero discrepancies or HR approval, API versioning /api/v1 current /api/v2 new sunset 90d
- **10.10 Legacy migration bridge V47:** migration_staging schema raw_employees/raw_contracts/raw_evidence no constraints 100% captured, scrubbers Contract Resolver overlaps/gaps BLOCK Position Mapper legacy titles→position_directory via lookup WARN Evidence Hasher SHA-256 missing files BLOCK, validation log migration_validation_errors (staging_table, row_id, error_message, severity WARN/BLOCK, resolved), audit trail migration_audit_log (actor_role nurseapp_migration_admin, action, target_table, row_count, statement), lookup tables unit_map raw_unit→unit_code FK nursing_units code position_map raw_position→position_code FK position_directory code, mapper functions map_unit() map_pos() STABLE SET search_path, commitValidatedData() verifies zero BLOCK then INSERT INTO...SELECT, staging wiped after commit role deleted

### Enterprise Integration (Section 14)
- **14.1 FHIR:** Employee→Practitioner (Identifier job-number, Name, Telecom), Credential→PractitionerRole.qualifications (SCFHS), Unit/Position→PractitionerRole.specialty, two separate resources linked by reference Practitioner and PractitionerRole (earlier returned practitionerRole inside Practitioner invalid — failed HL7 validator), both must pass HL7 FHIR R4 validator (11.3), controller decorated guarded, organization display, qualification identifier system http://scfhs.org.sa/registration
- **14.2 Attendance:** attendance_events (employee_id, event_type CLOCK_IN/CLOCK_OUT/BREAK_START/BREAK_END, event_timestamp, device_id, location_code, unique employee_id+event_timestamp), fhir_resource_mapping (internal_id PK e.g. Employee:123, fhir_resource_id global UUID, resource_type Practitioner, last_synced_at), gap detection query timezone-safe explicit Asia/Riyadh timestamptz construction phantom start_date removed 15min alert window bounds repeats, coverage_alert_log assignment_id+window_start unique key provable repeat suppression same transaction as push send, simulated missing clock-in triggers coverage alert within 15min
- **14.3 Portability:** Standardized exit package — workforce master CSV/JSON dump including PII decrypted, contract history full ledger, credential archive mapping+ZIP renamed EMP_[ID]_[TEMPLATE]_[DATE].pdf, audit manifest CSV hash-chained integrity, export service generateHospitalExitPackage fetchAllWorkforceData downloadAllEvidence Archiver finalize, vendor-neutral schema validated

### Additional Implementation Specs
- **PDPL (8.3) V35:** Field-level encryption AES-256-GCM, blind indexing V37 (iqama_blind_index, passport_blind_index, scfhs_reg_blind_index + blind_key_version pepper rotation HMAC key follows master key HSM/KMS/vault, <100ms O(1) lookup, query logs show blind_index not name/tracking_data, plaintext search returns zero), crypto-shredding V38, processing register, data-subject requests, breach notification, log redaction, residency check fail-closed KSA (me-south-1 Bahrain removed from allowlist, empty/polluted/unknown/sandbox markers refuse to boot, assertResidencyFromEnv() in main.ts+main-worker.ts before HTTP listener)
- **Idempotency (9.5) + Cleanup:** Guard, interceptor, cleanup worker V49 lease
- **Bundle Budget (2.8) B-19:** scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs fails build when gzipped budget exceeded entry 200KB gz (spec had 266.47KB Unmet — now MET at 66KB) chunk 150KB gz vendor long-cached 400KB, wire into CI after frontend build
- **Residency Check (B-25):** KSA region allowlist correction me-south-1 Bahrain removed, fail-closed, test it, startup refuses to boot with out-of-KSA region
- **CI Alignment (B-02):** Node 20 / PG 15 CI alignment, pin engines, CI runner image, Prisma client present in runtime image, Dockerfile node:20-alpine explicit prisma generate prod-deps stage NODE_ENV=production HEALTHCHECK
- **Guard Ordering (B-04) + Cookie (B-03):** Controller-level guard ordering AuthGuard,RbacGuard,CsrfGuard, remove APP_GUARD registration, e2e cases cookie naming reload-refresh missing CSRF foreign Origin missing idempotency key

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- **Session:** HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax cookie `nurseapp_refresh` scoped to `/api/v1/auth`, access token memory 15min, CSRF token header, Origin check, guard order controller level
- **Onboarding:** REVOKE INSERT employees, SECURITY DEFINER fn, atomic tx, no ghost employees
- **Privileges:** 4 roles least-privilege, post-migration grants, temporary migration_admin 48h
- **Audit:** Hash-chained, append-only, runtime cannot DELETE/UPDATE, PDPL encrypted, crypto-shredding preserves chain
- **PII:** AES-256-GCM field-level, blind indexing HMAC <100ms, log redaction, residency fail-closed KSA
- **Backup:** GPG public-key backup host private key restore host only, envelope check vs decryptability, WAL archive atomic mv, wal-restore wrapper prevents zero-length WAL, PITR, monthly drill, RPO ≤5min RTO <4h
- **Upload:** Quarantine PENDING→ClamAV CLEAN/INFECTED, magic bytes, 10MB, only CLEAN downloadable, EICAR
- **Evidence Vault:** Private storage, 403 direct, signed URL 30s then 403, SHA-256 tampering detection
- **Admin:** PAM JIT elevation, four-eyes dual-auth SELECT FOR UPDATE PENDING precondition self-approval forbidden, break-glass siren irrevocable 4h limit
- **Resilience:** Worker leases V49 heartbeat expiry takeover, idempotency lease 409 only while live retaken not blocked, SCFHS circuit breaker STALE 48h, Redis fallback no 500

---

## 🌐 i18n & RTL

- Toggle via header globe button or user menu
- `setLanguage('en'|'ar')` → localStorage, i18n.changeLanguage, documentElement.lang/dir, body.dir
- Ant Design ConfigProvider direction rtl, Sider fixed left/right based on RTL
- All UI strings in translation files, no hardcoded (spec acceptance)
- Bilingual notifications read user preferred language from profile

---

## 📊 Bundle Optimization (Section 2.8)

**Before (spec):** Single bundle 266.47KB gzipped entry — Unmet target <200KB, Vite build warning

**After (this implementation):**
- Entry (index + vendor-react): 66.57KB gz < 200KB — **TARGET MET** ✅
- Route chunks: 0.18KB - 8.23KB gz each < 150KB — all OK ✅
- Vendor chunks: vendor-antd 340KB gz (long-cached, infrequent change), vendor-utils 17KB, vendor-react 51KB — cached long-term
- Strategy: React.lazy per route, Suspense PageSkeleton, manualChunks vendor separation, NavLink preload on mouseenter/focus hides latency, Ant Design icons individual imports, dayjs locales excluded

**CI Gate:** `node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` after frontend build fails if entry >200KB gz or any route chunk >150KB gz. Vite's chunkSizeWarningLimit 250 raw-kB warning must never be raised to silence — real gate is gzipped budget check.
