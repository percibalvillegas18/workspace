-- Probe table for the failure-injection drill.
--
-- The restore drill answers "can we go back in time?". This table answers the
-- complementary question: "when the machine dies mid-write, is what the client
-- was told 'committed' still there afterwards?"
--
-- One row per client-confirmed transaction. The drill knows exactly how many
-- transactions returned COMMIT, so after an unclean kill the count must match
-- exactly -- no more, no less.
