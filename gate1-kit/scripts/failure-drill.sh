#
# Failure injection for Gate 1. The restore drill proves "we can go back in
# time"; this proves the two things a restore drill cannot:
#
#   --crash  Durability and atomicity under an unclean kill.
#            The server is SIGKILLed (real power-loss shape: no checkpoint, no
#            clean shutdown) and we assert:
#              * every transaction that returned COMMIT is still present
#              * a transaction that had NOT committed is rolled back in full
#              * the audit hash chain is still unbroken
#              * crash recovery actually ran (not a clean shutdown in disguise)
#
#   --rpo    Recovery Point Objective, measured black-box rather than asserted.
#            A marker is committed, we wait for the WAL segment containing it to
#            appear in the ENCRYPTED archive (no forced switches -- those would
#            cheat the measurement), then we actually restore to that commit's
#            timestamp and confirm the marker is there. The elapsed time is the
#            real RPO, compared against archive_timeout.
#
# All probe rows are scoped by a per-run tag, and NOTHING is ever deleted from
# audit_entries: removing rows from the middle of a hash chain breaks the chain,
# which is precisely what this drill is supposed to be checking.
#
# Output: gate1-failure-evidence.md + a summary on stdout. Non-zero on failure.
