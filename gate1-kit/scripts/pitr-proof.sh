# Drives a *provable* point-in-time-recovery test.
#
# The restore drill on its own can only prove "the restore ran". It cannot prove
# that recovery stopped at the requested instant, because if nothing is written
# after the target there is nothing for the cut to exclude. This driver removes
# that blind spot:
#
#   1. write PRE-target marker rows        -> must be PRESENT after restore
#   2. force a WAL switch and wait         -> those rows reach the archive
#   3. capture T0 from the database clock
#   4. write POST-target marker rows       -> must be ABSENT after restore
#   5. force a WAL switch and wait         -> the post-target WAL reaches the
#                                             archive too, so their absence
#                                             proves a time-based cut, not a
#                                             missing-segment accident
#   6. run restore-drill.sh with TARGET_TIME=T0
#   7. assert on the restored instance
#
# Usage:
#   TARGET_TIME is NOT set by the caller; this script derives it.
