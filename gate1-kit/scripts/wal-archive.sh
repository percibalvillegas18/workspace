# Archives WAL segments to encrypted backup storage.
# Called by PostgreSQL archive_command with %p (source path) and %f (filename).
#
# F-23 FIX 1: PostgreSQL retries archive_command until it succeeds, so this
# script must never leave a partial file behind. It encrypts to a temporary
# path and moves it into place only after the envelope check passes.
#
# F-23 FIX 4: the envelope check verifies the output is a real public-key
# encrypted message, not just a non-empty file.
